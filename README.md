# ODE-parameter-estimation-python

Here you can find my codes to find ODE parameters having some noisy observation,
The codes are commented in french (because I am frenche, but if needed I could translate my comment at english)

I will probably also share my latex work where the theory is presented (it will be at french ^^)

the file (*Lotka-Volterra classical methods*) is a code where I compute two classical methods and test them with this model.
