ODE-parameter-estimation-python
===============================

Here you can find my codes to find ODE parameters having some noisy observation,
The codes are commented in french (because I am french, but if needed I could translate my comment at english)

I will probably also share my latex work where the theory is presented (it will be at french ^^)


I - Lotka-Volterra classical methods.py
---------------------------------------

In this file we can found three classical methods (the gradient descent, the Newton and the Gauss-Newton method).
To try them, in the Lotka-Volterra model, we only to respectively launch :

|  "testMethodeDescenteEnGradientLV()"       #if we want the Gradient descent method
|  "testMethodesDeNewtonLV()"                #if we want to see the Gauss-Newton and Newton method
|  "test()"                                  #if we want to see all these methods

II - Bayesian approach GP Lotka-Volterra
