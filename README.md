# ODE-parameter-estimation-python

Here you can find my codes to find ODE parameters having some noisy observation,
The codes are commented in french (because I am frenche, but if needed I could translate my comment at english)

the file Lotka-Volterra version propre is a code where I compute two classical methods and test them with this model
